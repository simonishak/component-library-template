# Getting Started

This is a skeleton project for creating a component library with React, Material UI and Story Book for autogenerated documentation. There is a "Playground"-project included so you can test the library build as you develop locally.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app using Rollup (Dist folder).

### `npm run build-watch`

Builds the app using Rollup but also creates a watcher that rebuilds if any changes are made.

### `npm run start-playground`

Goes into the directory for the playground project and starts the local server.

### `npm run i-all`

npm install in root project and CD into playground and npm installs.

### `npm run dev`

Runs `npm-run-all` and starts the build-watch and playground.

### `npm run storybook`

Runs the autogenerated storybook docs.

### `npm run build-storybook`

Builds the storybook docs.

## More to come

Documentation to be updated.
